(4) Let's Install MySql & PHPmyAdmin

MySQL is a database management system. Basically, it will organize and provide 
access to databases where your site can store information.

phpMyAdmin was created so that users can interact with MySQL through a web interface.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1) MySQL

Again, use "apt" to acquire and install this software:
	$ sudo apt install mysql-server

You will again be shown a list of the packages that will be installed, along 
with the amount of disk space they'll take up. Enter "Y" to continue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the installation is complete, run a simple security script that comes pre-installed 
with MySQL which will remove some dangerous defaults and lock down access to your database 
system. Start the interactive script by running:
	$ sudo mysql_secure_installation


You will be asked if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN.

Note: Enabling this feature is something of a judgment call. If enabled, passwords which 
don't match the specified criteria will be rejected by MySQL with an error. This will cause 
issues if you use a weak password in conjunction with software which automatically configures 
MySQL user credentials, such as the Ubuntu packages for phpMyAdmin. It is safe to leave 
validation disabled, but you should always use strong, unique passwords for database credentials.

Answer "Y" for yes, or anything else to continue without enabling.

VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin?

Press "y"|"Y" for Yes, any "other key" for No:

If you answer “yes”, you'll be asked to select a level of password validation. 
Keep in mind that if you enter 2 for the strongest level, you will receive errors 
when attempting to set any password which does not contain numbers, upper and lowercase 
letters, and special characters, or which is based on common dictionary words.

There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 1

Regardless of whether you chose to set up the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN, your server 
will next ask you to select and confirm a password for the MySQL root user. 
This is an administrative account in MySQL that has increased privileges. 
Think of it as being similar to the root account for the server itself (although the 
one you are configuring now is a MySQL-specific account). Make sure this is a strong, 
unique password, and do not leave it blank.

If you enabled password validation, you'll be shown the password strength for the root 
password you just entered and your server will ask if you want to change that password. 
If you are happy with your current password, enter "N" for "no" at the prompt:

Using existing password for root.

Estimated strength of the password: 100
Change the password for root ? ((Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : n

For the rest of the questions, press "Y" and hit the "ENTER" key at each prompt. 
This will remove some anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, 
and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes you have made.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check the status of the mysql service using systemctl:

    $ sudo systemctl status mysql 

Press "q" to exit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2) PHPMyAdmin
 
	$ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-gettext

This will ask you a few questions in order to configure your installation correctly.

Warning: When the first prompt appears, apache2 is highlighted, but not selected. 
If you do not hit "Space" to select Apache, the installer will not move the necessary files during installation. 
Hit "Space", "Tab", and then "Enter" to select Apache.

    For the server selection, choose "apache2".
    Select "yes" when asked whether to use dbconfig-common to set up the database
    You will be prompted for your database administrator's password
    You will then be asked to choose and confirm a password for the phpMyAdmin application itself

The installation process actually adds the phpMyAdmin Apache configuration file into the 
/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/ directory, where it is automatically read.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Add the following line at the end:
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pointing to php7.1-mcrypt with php7.2 will solve the issue here. Below are the steps to configure 7.1 version mcrypt with php7.2

Install php7.1-mcrypt

	$ sudo apt install php7.1-mcrypt


Create symbolic link to php7.1-mcrypt

	$ sudo ln -s /etc/php/7.1/mods-available/mcrypt.ini /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/


Enable mcrypt extension

	$ sudo phpenmod mcrypt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	$ sudo a2dismod php7.0
	
	$ sudo a2enmod php7.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Afterwards, you'll need to restart Apache for your changes to be recognized:
	$ sudo systemctl restart apache2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now access the web interface by visiting your server's domain name or 
public IP address followed by /phpmyadmin:
https://domain_name_or_IP/phpmyadmin
